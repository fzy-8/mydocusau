Blog features are powered by the blog plugin. Simply add files to the `blog` directory. It supports tags as well!


Delete the whole directory if you don't want the blog features. As simple as that!

I am referencing a [document](doc2.md).

Reference to another [document in a subfolder](subfolder/doc3.md).

[Relative document](../otherFolder/doc4.md) referencing works as well.
